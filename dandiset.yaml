description: This dataset was collected to study the functional consequences of age-related
  hearing loss for the auditory nerve, which carries acoustic information from the
  periphery to the central auditory system. Using high-impedance glass electrodes,
  raw voltage traces and spike times were recorded from more than one thousand single
  fibres of the auditory nerve of young-adult, middle-aged, and old Mongolian gerbils
  raised in a quiet environment. The dataset contains not only responses to simple
  acoustic stimuli to characterize the fibres, but also to more complex stimuli, such
  as speech logatomes in background noise and Schroeder-phase stimuli. A software
  toolbox is provided to search through the dataset, to plot various analysed outcomes,
  and to give insight into the analyses. This dataset may serve as a valuable resource
  to test further hypotheses about age-related hearing loss. Additionally, it can
  aid in optimizing available computational models of the auditory system, which can
  contribute to, or eventually even fully replace, animal experiments.
